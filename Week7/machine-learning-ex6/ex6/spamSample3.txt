Dear Xiaorui Zhu,

Congratulations on your admission to the University of Cincinnati. We have received your financial documents and they are in order. Your I-20 form will be issued with 5 business days.

We have noted that you have stated that you are in F-2 status.  Do you intend to leave the US and apply for an F-1 visa this summer, or will you remain in the US and file an application for a change in your immigration status?


Congratulations again on your admission to the University of Cincinnati.

James
